# Prologue

##About this publication
This is the prologue to my book that I am writing for my GitHub class.

I never wanted to be a librarian. Orginally, I wanted to be a news anchor, and then later a Theatre Professor. But I worked in the librayr during my undergrad and it captured me in a way I did not expect.
